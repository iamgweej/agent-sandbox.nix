# Test: the paths that let a sandboxed process run code on the host the next
# time git is used (hooks, config, config.worktree, submodule gitdirs, and
# the commondir/.git pointers that redirect git elsewhere) are read-only for
# the repo the sandbox was launched in, while commits and fetches keep
# working. objects/info/alternates is pinned alongside them: it redirects
# object lookup rather than execution, so it cannot substitute content, but it
# can leave the repo depending on an object store the sandbox placed.
# Read-only is not inert: a hook the human installed must still run from
# every launch position, which is pinned here too.
# Repos that merely sit under a writable launch directory are a documented
# non-goal, pinned by the last case here.
